        <h1> About </h1>
        <p>
      I am currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the University of Idaho as a junior. Through coursework and side projects I have been developing my skills in Full-Stack Development using C, C++, Python, and ReactJS.
 
I graduated valedictorian at Enumclaw High School with my associate degree from Green River College the prior to this past summer, lettering in Water-Polo and swimming. This rigorous schedule showcased my tenacity to work hard and forced me to develop time management skills. I am also an Eagle Scout, which gave me the opportunity to hone in on my leadership, project management, and mentoring skills.
 
When there is spare time, I enjoy building useful projects, learning algorithms, and researching
various topics, from coding practices, machine learning, to data science. 
 
My attention to detail, problem-solving, and excellent communication skills would be an asset to any team.
