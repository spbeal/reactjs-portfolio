        Welcome to my website, my name is Samuel. I am a Computer Science Student at University of Idaho. Experienced in C++, basic python, and basic web development.
        When I'm not studying, I am out with friends, playing water polo, rugby, swing dancing, or programming a new project.
    </p>

    <p>
    My current goals would have to be building innovative knowledge in the area of Computer Science, and using that to help people. A computer science degree will provide me with a strong basis to achieve these goals, as it provides me with the environment to network, tone my skills, and bring out my creativity.
     At that, I am glad to have the opportunity to work alongside professors, peers, and build projects that will be invaluable to my growth.
    In college I am trying to network as much as possible, apply to every internship, and take full advantage of the community around me so that I can make these goals a reality. I know it isn't going to be easy, but I know that if I consistently work hard, my goals will come true.
